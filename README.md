# Blockpedia 📑

“The Open Brain of Web3.”

Blockpedia is an open knowledge base for the world of Web3 — covering blockchain, smart contracts, crypto, DAOs, NFTs, DeFi, metaverse, and beyond.
It stores concepts, definitions, best practices, taxonomy, case studies, and standards in a structured, community-driven way.

Built with Docusaurus-style, powered by GitHub contributions, and connected with Learn3, STC DataHub, and RANTAI Nexus.

## 🌍 Vision

> Make Web3 knowledge open, structured, and alive — for learners, builders, researchers, and communities worldwide.

Blockpedia is not just documentation. It’s a knowledge cycle:

- Learn from concepts

- Practice in real projects

- Document outcomes

- Share with the community

- Feed back into knowledge

---

## 🔗 Ecosystem

Blockpedia connects with:

- Learn3 → courses and labs cite Blockpedia entries for theory.

- STC DataHub → datasets and case studies are documented here.

- RANTAI Nexus → discussions and insights feed into Blockpedia.

- STC Projects → experiments and tools are referenced in entries.
